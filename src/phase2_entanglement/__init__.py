Phase 2: Entanglement and Bell's Inequality
============================================

This module explores two-qubit systems, entanglement, and the foundations
of quantum non-locality through Bell's inequality.

Key concepts:
- Bell states and maximally entangled states
- Schmidt decomposition and entanglement measures
- Partial trace and reduced density matrices
- CHSH inequality and quantum violation
- Quantum vs classical correlations

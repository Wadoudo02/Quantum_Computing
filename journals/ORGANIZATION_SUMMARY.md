## ✅ Verification

### Tests Performed

1. ✅ **Directory Structure Created:**
   ```bash
   ls -R journals/
   # Shows all phase directories and setup
   ```

2. ✅ **Files Moved:**
   ```bash
   ls journals/phase1/ | wc -l
   # Returns: 6 files

   ls journals/setup/ | wc -l
   # Returns: 5 files
   ```

3. ✅ **Root Directory Clean:**
   ```bash
   ls *.md | wc -l
   # Returns: 3 files (README, QUICK_START, quantum_master_plan)
   ```

4. ✅ **References Updated:**
